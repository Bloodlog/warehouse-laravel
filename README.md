## About Warehouse Laravel

Warehouse laravel is a web application developed as a pet project.

On my github there is the first version of the warehouse in which there were many errors.
I wanted to work on the bugs and rewrite the old application using Laravel

- Adding warehouses
- Adding categories for products
- Adding products
- Adding invoices
- Updating invoices
- Write-off from the warehouse
- Displaying the latest stock balances
- Recalculation of balances when updating invoices

Stack: php8, Laravel, postgresql, phpunit

Plans to add frontend, auth, docker-compose
